# sendgridjs-demo

Simplified version of [sendgridjs](http://github.com/scottmotte/sendgridjs) for demo purposes.

## Approach

Start with static app that wants to send an email from the front-end. Show clicking the button and how it console logs.

Then switch to changing that console.log to actually sending out an email.

## Usage

```
open ./static-example/index.html
node app.js
```
